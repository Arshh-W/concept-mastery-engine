 Flux: Concept Mastery Engine

Track: AI | Problem Statement: PS-AI-3

Flux is an adaptive simulation engine designed to build deep technical intuition for Operating Systems and DBMS. Unlike static tools, Flux treats learning as a dynamic control problem.

#Core Engineering

    Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT): Uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to map the user's latent mastery state rather than raw scores.

    PID-Driven Difficulty Scaling: A real-time control loop that adjusts system entropy (e.g., cache miss penalties) based on performance deltas.

    DAG-Based Pathfinding: Implements Topological Sorting for O(V+E) prerequisite management.

#Tech Stack

    Backend: Python (BKT Logic, AST Analysis via sqlparse).

    Simulation: C++ Core for deterministic timing and low-level memory control.

    Frontend: React.js + D3.js for high-fidelity data-binding and visual proof of system states.

#Roadmap

    Phase 1: BKT Engine & OS Memory Simulation Logic.

    Phase 2: D3 Visualizers for B-Trees & Fragmentation.

    Phase 3: SQL-to-AST VM Shim for low-latency execution
